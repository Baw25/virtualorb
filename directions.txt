Now that you know more about the device we've created called an Orb, with the help of distributors, we are going to sign up and give away Worldcoin tokens to people around the world. For the purpose of this exercise, the signup works by submitting an iris image in a png format to the backend where it’s transformed into a hash and checked if it’s unique among the ones we've already seen.

We would like to ask you to write a "virtual orb" that could be used as a part of our testing infrastructure. You can imagine running it in a CI pipeline or being deployed as a workload in multiple regions and constantly validating our system.

The orb should:
- Periodically report status by calling an API and submitting battery, cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space
- Periodically simulate a signup and submit images to the API with an associated id

You can choose the language you feel most comfortable with, we have a slight preference for Java, Go, C++, Python. You have the freedom of deciding how the API will look like and we care about testing. This task will likely not take more than 4-5h and if it should, please try to prioritize the work and describe the work that you would accomplish if you would have more time. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. 

Please submit your solution in the link below. 


Summary:
- giving away Worldcoin tokens to people around the world 
- signup:
    - submitting iris image - png format
    - image transformed into a hash 
    - hash checked if it's unique among saved hashes from other users 

Ask:
- write virtual orb
    - used as part of testing infra - running on CI pipeline or deployed as a workload in multiple regions and constantly validating our system
    - reports status periodically by reporting battery, cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space 
    - simulate a signup and submit images to the API with an associated id 

- Write in golang, python, or java 

- Freedom to deciding how API looks like and we care about testing 

- Overall requirements of the orb:
    - checks if you are real
    - checks if you have signed up before



Questions:
By creating virtual orb, am I creating an API that has two endpoints that:
1) reports its status by reporting battery, cpu storage, cpu temp, disk space
2) simulates a signup by taking png images 

By creating a "virtual orb", I imagine that I'm creating a simulator for an orb that does two things:
1) reports its status by reporting battery, cpu storage, cpu temp, disk space to some API
2) simulates a signup by submitting png images with associated id's to an API 

I have the following questions:
1) Am I creating this API that receives the signup requests and requests reporting the orb status? Is there any existing API endpoints I need to use? 
2) If "yes" in question 1 (if I'm creating this API), are there a set of requirements for it? 
3) Another understanding I have is that I design an API that has 2 endpoints that receive status requests from an orb and image requests. I would then 
check for matches between the submitted iris images and existing images for signups. However, what exactly would you want to happen with status reports? 
Store them in a local db or locally via another mechanism? 

If some of the answers to these questions are up to my disgression (if this is an open ended exercise), please let me know performance requirements. Otherwise, 
I would appreciate some clarity in these areas. Thanks for any help in advance.
