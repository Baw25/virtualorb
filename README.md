# virtualorb

Simulator for orb signups and status report (battery, cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space) requests for the purpose of testing. 
The orb can: 
- Simulate periodic report status requests reporting cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space of current machine 
- Simulate signups and submit png images to a mock API with generated associated ids

The idea is that can be used as part of a CI pipeline or deployed as a workload.

## Setup

## Example
```
   python simulator.py 
```

### Example Output:
