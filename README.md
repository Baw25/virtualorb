# virtualorb

Simulator for orb signups and status report (battery, cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space) requests for the purpose of testing. 
The orb can: 
- Simulate periodic report status requests reporting cpu usage, cpu temp, disk space of current machine 
- Simulate signups and submit png images to a mock API with generated associated ids

The idea is that can be used as part of a CI pipeline or deployed as a workload.

## Setup

### Dependencies
Make sure to have the following:
- [`python >= 3.6.0`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [`go >= 1.16`](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [`gin web framework = 1.8.1`](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#installation)
- [`osx-cpu-temp project`](https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp)
- [`beeceptor mock API`](https://virtualorb-mock-backend.free.beeceptor.com/)
- lm-sensors (if you have linux machine)

### Getting Started
Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build project and osx-cpu-temp subproject
```
make build
```
Run tests:
```
make test
```
Run the virtualorb server
```
make run
```
Open additional terminal and run simulator.py to simulate report and signup submissions

## Examples
Run 1 test signup and 1 test report
```
   python simulator.py 
```
Or run any combination of report or signup submissions over intervals of time. 

Run 5 test signups with 2 second intervals in between
```
   python simulator.py iterations=5 interval=2
```
Run 10 test report submissions with 2 second intervals in between
```
   python simulator.py iterations=10 interval=2 report
```

### Example Output for 1 signup and 1 report:
```
Running simulator
Sending signup request...
Signup generated:
{'action_id': '40df4e77-4b3f-4d11-aecb-cfeb5c335429',

 'device_cpu_temp': '43Â°C',
 'device_disk_space_available_percent': '92.929450',
 'device_disk_space_used_percent': '7.070550'}
```

## Improvements or next steps
For the sake of this project, basic unit tests were included, but testing could be expanded to include more e2e test cases especially for the reporting functions (i.e. cpu temp). Testing primarily checked for types and functionality, but mocking should be utilized more for functions using 3rd party dependencies. The status reporting primarily assumed retrieving status statistics from the current machine, but other reporting practices mimicking orb reporting could be deployed. Signups were also created in such a way that adhered to the directions of this project, but could be refactored to match actual orb iris submissions to verify identity. Furthermore, a backend besides the mock beeceptor API could be deployed matching the orb backend behavior by simulating an identity verification using mock iris submissions similar to this project. Naturally, this project could also be configured and deployed for test workloads.
